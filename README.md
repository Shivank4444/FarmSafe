# FarmSafe

## Overview

Farmers often face uncertainties in accessing stable markets, leading to unpredictable incomes and financial instability. To address this challenge, we propose the development of FarmSafeâ€”a comprehensive platform designed to provide farmers with guaranteed buyers for their crops through transparent, secure, and reliable agreements. The platform will enable farmers to create listings for their crops, negotiate with buyers, and finalize terms using customizable contract templates. 

## Vision

Our vision is to empower farmers with guaranteed market access and income stability through transparent and secure contract agreements, supported by blockchain technology 
## Features

- **Crop Listings**: Farmers can create detailed listings for their crops, specifying yield, quality, and price expectations.

- **Customizable Contract Templates**: Tailored contract templates for agreements covering terms like price, delivery schedules, and payment methods.

- **Interest Button with Instant Notification**: The platform includes an "Interested" button in the crop listing section. When clicked, it sends an instant message to the crop owner (farmer), notifying them that a buyer is interested, streamlining communication and enabling quick negotiation and decision-making.
